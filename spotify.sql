-- ========================================

-- BUSINESS OBJECTIVE
/*

Music plays an important role in human life. People turn to it in moments of joy, sadness, focus and celebration. With the growth of streaming platform like Spotify and Youtube, listening habits 
have shifted from owning physical albums to having instant access to millions of tracks across different moods and genres. Spotify is one of the leading platforms driving this change, giving 
listeners personalised playlists, recommendations and endless choice.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Spotify and contains detailed information about a large collection of songs. It includes both descriptive attributes such as track name, artist
and genre, as well as numerical features like tempo, loudness, energy, danceability and popularity. Together, these variables provide a structured way to understand what defines modern music and 
what listeners engage with most.

By analyzing this dataset, the project aims to uncover trends that explain how certain audio features influence a song’s popularity. We will look at whether faster tempos, higher energy or specific 
genres attract more listeners. We will also considers how patterns in music data can highlight broader shifts in audience preferences over time.

The goal is to understand music consumption on a larger scale. We can better appreciate the characteristics that shape successful songs and learn how music continues to adapt to listeners’ tastes 
in the age of streaming.

/*
The music industry is no longer just about talent it's about understanding listener behavior. Artists and producers can use these insights to:
- Optimise releases (Spotify for streams, YouTube for virality)

Music will always be a piece of art that is blend with alot of creativity. Artists can craft songs that not only just sound good but also they perform exceptionally.
